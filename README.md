# judyalter-cloudflare

A website created using a [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) framework for my friend [Judy Alter](https://twitter.com/judy__alter). 

HUGO was chosen for its simplicity and low requirements, which allowed for quick development and deployment.
The entire project was based on a great theme [ethernity](https://github.com/boratanrikulu/eternity) created for art portfolios and other creativity driven websites. It was quite heavily modified to fit the tone of the artworks and commission driven purpose of the site.

For the ease of usage, website was adapted to work with [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/), an open-source headless CMS.
